<!-- <p>Your<script>characterName</script> eyes slowly open.<br><br> The first thing you’re aware of is that you’re lying on your back on the hard, cracked dirt. <br>How did you get here? With all your energy, you heave yourself into a sitting position.<br> Your head throbs. Dry, brown grass pushes through the large cracks in the earth, and the song of those annoying, endlessly droning insects is ceaseless. <br>You start to stand, and realize your hand is clutching something rather tightly. You open it.<br> Ouch, that hurt—your hand must have been clenched like that for quite some time.<br> You glance at the small, brown objects and your heart leaps. Your dice!<br> (DESCRIBE DICE HERE) Now at least you have some chance of survival in this strange world.<br>You look around, trying to get your bearings. You seem to be in the middle of a field or what once was a field, anyway.<br> There is a black smudge on the horizon, and after studying it for some time, you realize it's smoke. A city?<br> At any rate, it's the only point of interest in this odd place, everything else is desolation.<br> Out of habit, you grab your <strong>SIX-SIDED DIE</strong>, but then quickly laugh at yourself. There is only one choice to be made here.<br> You drop all your dice into your shirt's special dice pocket...</p>
